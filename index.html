            <p>EA Sports deserves credit for the journey it has undertaken with FIFA. Starting off at the current-gen consoles’ launch with the ill-fated Ignite Engine, each year it was clear what the team was trying to implement. At times, the baby steps fixed some areas, while breaking others, like when heading became so overpowered for big men, many matches became a David Moyes cross-fest. Thankfully, crosses were broken at the same time, too, meaning there was some bastardised form of perfect imbalance.</p>

                <p></p>Fortnite: Battle Royale is a fast-paced arcade alternative to PUBG, but it fails in the tension department. Its good fun when you play like you don’t only have one life, but that in and of itself makes it feel like an oddity that hasn’t quite found its identity yet. The Save the World campaign makes better use of Fortnite’s mechanics, but it’s severely hampered by its needlessly elaborate progression system. Both modes show promise, but fall short, mainly from trying to do too much.</p>

                <p>It’s still good to have customisation of any sort back in Need for Speed, and with it comes several basic tuning options you can use to alter your car’s driving characteristics. The main slider adjusts all settings, nudging your car towards a drift setup or a grip setup, but you can dive deeper and massage certain steering, tyre pressure, and braking power settings individually to fine tune your ride. I much preferred the drift setup for all race types because I found it far easier to get around corners by poising my Focus in a slide via a bootful of throttle and liberal use of opposite lock, rather than navigate the bends with a grip tune. </p>
